# RAM (Random Access Memories)

## Powered by Angular 2, MongoDB, Redis and Express

## Why RAM?
First, nothing to do with the RAM of a computer. RAM is a photo stock web app with a UI 
resembling my favorite photo stock site, [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). Before you call me a lazy developer for
making a copy of pexels, I made this for the sole purpose of getting some practice with the
APIs mentioned above, not to make something new. RAM is still in the works but eventually you will be able to 

- Upload pictures
- Download pictures
- Add tags to the pictures (location, photographer, etc.)
- A search box that searches the database by any of the tags.

For any comments on the app, feel free to reach me at jv1019@nyu.edu. Enjoy :)
